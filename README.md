# LeetCode JavaScript Practice 

This repository contains my daily JavaScript practice from LeetCode.
The goal is to strengthen core programming concepts, problem-solving skills,
and build a strong foundation for frontend and software development roles.
Each problem is practiced with clarity, comments, and learning-focused solutions.

##  Practice Log

###  Topic: Closures (JavaScript)

In this section, I practiced problems related to JavaScript closures.
I learned how inner functions can remember variables from their outer scope
even after the outer function has finished execution.

###  Key Concepts Learned
- What a closure is and how it works
- Lexical scope in JavaScript
- Returning functions from functions
- Maintaining state using closures (counter problems)

###  Problems Practiced
- Create a function that always returns `"Hello World"`
- Create a counter function that increments on every call
- Understanding scope errors like calling inner functions directly
- Fixing common closure mistakes (unused expressions vs assignment)

## ## LeetCode Practice – createCounter

Practiced the `createCounter` problem using JavaScript closures.  
Implemented `increment`, `decrement`, and `reset` methods.  
Learned how closures preserve state across function calls.  
Tested the solution locally in VS Code.

## Language Used: JavaScript  
## Focus: Learning concepts, not optimization
